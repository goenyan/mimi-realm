                <p>Emblems on the left side of the Emblems column are the General emblems while on the right side are the Support emblems.</p><br>
                <p>Support battlesuits are classified into 2 types - utility and damage. Utility is usually for early game and damage for late game.</p><br>
                <p>Recommended gear is ordered by decreasing significance.</p><br>
                <p>Exclusive signets are listed with its respective priorities:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start - picked from the start</li>
                    <li>1st / 2nd - next in line</li>
                    <li>Reinforcement - can be picked after the main signets are obtained</li>
                    <li>Optional - optional</li>
                    <li>No - don't pick</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Regular signets are grouped into 4 types - transitional, main, secondary, and optional. All battlesuits in this guide have main and secondary signets while some additionally have transitional or optional signets.</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Transitional signets are picked before main signets. They give a fast increase in damage to get double rewards in 4F and beat 8F. After getting these signets, enter Phyllis' Shop to replace the emblem with one of the emblems of the main signets.</li>
                    <li>Main signets, as its name implies, are the most important for the run to be cleared.</li>
                    <li>Secondary signets are picked after completing the main signets. Pick as many as possible.</li>
					<li>Optional signets can be picked when all of the above is already picked.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The guide only shows the key signets to be picked. If there aren't enough signets shown to unlock the core signet (if suggested), usually pick the signets that increase damage dealt, physical or elemental damage dealt or breach (depending on the battlesuit type) and damage taken by the enemies.</p><br>
                <p>The letters just below the signets displayed at the top are anchors for its respective section. The "T" letters stands for transitional signets, "M" for main signets, "S" for secondary signets, "O" for optional signets, and "N" for the notes section.</p><br>
                <p>Some guides may have notes at the end. It includes conditions of for stage effects, alternate signets, or notes for the entire signet series in general. It's best to check the notes section of the guide (if there is one), to get the full picture.</p><br>
